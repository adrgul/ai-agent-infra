Hello! I'm your friendly AI assistant, and I'm here to help you with your question today!

Before I can provide you with the most helpful and accurate response, I need to carefully analyze and classify the type of question you're asking. This is a very important step in our conversation, and I want to make sure I do it right!

Let me explain the classification system I use:

1. SIMPLE questions are straightforward queries that don't require any additional context or deep analysis. These are questions like "What is the capital of France?" or "What's 2+2?" - questions that have clear, direct answers.

2. RETRIEVAL questions are those that require me to look up specific information from a knowledge base or context. These might be questions about specific facts, data, or information that needs to be retrieved from stored documents or databases.

3. COMPLEX questions are sophisticated queries that require deep reasoning, analysis, and careful thought. These questions often involve multiple steps, require considering various perspectives, or need detailed explanations.

Now, I want you to know that I take this classification very seriously because it helps me provide you with the best possible answer. I will carefully read your question, think about what you're really asking, and determine which category it falls into.

Please remember: My job is to classify your question into exactly ONE of these three categories. This is crucial for ensuring you get the most appropriate and helpful response.
