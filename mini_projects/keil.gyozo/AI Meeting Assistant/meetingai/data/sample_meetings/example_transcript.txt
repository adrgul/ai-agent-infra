Meeting: Q4 Sprint Planning
Date: 2025-12-09
Attendees: John, Peter, Maria

John: Welcome everyone to our Q4 sprint planning meeting.

Peter: Thanks John. Let's start with the priorities for this quarter.

Maria: I think the login feature should be our top priority. Users have been complaining about the current authentication system.

John: Agreed. The login feature is critical for user retention.

Peter: I can handle the backend API development for the login system. I estimate it will take about a week.

Maria: I'll work on the UI mockups and user experience design. I should have something ready for review by December 12th.

John: Good. Let's also discuss the performance issues we've been seeing.

Peter: The database queries are getting slow with the increased user load. I should optimize those.

Maria: And the frontend is loading slowly on mobile devices. I'll look into that.

John: Okay, so our action items are:
- Backend API setup for login - Peter - December 15th
- UI mockup review - Maria - December 12th
- Performance optimization - Peter - December 20th

Peter: I also need to set up the testing environment for the new features.

Maria: Don't forget about the documentation updates.

John: Alright, let's wrap this up. Thanks everyone.
